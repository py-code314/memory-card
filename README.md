## Overview

This project is a variation on popular memory game called "Concentration". The goal of this project is to create a simple and responsive memory card game using React and CSS. Rules of the game are simple: the player has to click on all the cards exactly once without repeating a card. With each click on a card, the player gets one point. The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible. The player wins the game when all the cards are clicked.
